### 🏗️ Generics & Constraints
*"Write one class. Make it work for every type — safely."*

You already know basic `List<T>`. But what about `where T : IComparable<T>, new()`? What happens when you combine multiple constraints? And what is **generic variance** (`in`/`out`) — why can you pass a `List<string>` as `IEnumerable<object>` but NOT as `List<object>`?

> **Payoff:** You'll understand exactly how `IEnumerable<out T>` works and why `List<T>` doesn't support covariance.

---

### 🪞 Reflection & Attributes
*"Code that reads itself — and changes at runtime."*

`typeof(MyClass).GetProperties()`. `[CustomAttribute]`. Runtime type inspection. Dynamically calling methods by name. Creating instances of unknown types. This is the engine behind every serializer, ORM, and DI container you've ever used.

> **Payoff:** You'll understand how `JsonSerializer`, Entity Framework, and ASP.NET controllers actually work under the hood.

---

### 🧬 Expression Trees (Deep Dive)
*"Your lambda is not just code — it's data. Readable, walkable, translatable data."*

You touched on this in LINQ Internals. Now go deep: build expression trees from scratch, walk them with visitors, modify them, compile them on the fly. This is how ORMs translate `p => p.Name == "Ali"` into `WHERE Name = 'Ali'`.

> **Payoff:** You'll be able to build your own mini-ORM or dynamic query builder.

---

### 🧵 Threading & Concurrency Internals
*"async/await is built on top of something deeper. What is it?"*

`Thread` vs `Task` vs `ThreadPool`. What does the ThreadPool actually do? How does `SynchronizationContext` work? What is `ExecutionContext`? What actually happens when you `await` — step by step inside the CLR? Lock-free programming with `Interlocked`. `ConcurrentDictionary`, `Channel<T>`.

> **Payoff:** You'll never write a deadlock again — and you'll know exactly why they happen.

---

### 🧩 Design Patterns in C# (The Real Way)
*"Patterns aren't abstract theory. In C#, delegates, generics, and interfaces make them elegant."*

- **Strategy** — swap algorithms via `Func<>` instead of subclassing
- **Decorator** — wrap any `Func<T,T>` with logging, retry, caching
- **Observer** — events done properly with weak references
- **Chain of Responsibility** — the middleware pipeline you already started
- **Template Method** — `abstract` + `virtual` the C# way

> **Payoff:** You'll recognize these patterns in every framework you use and write extensible code naturally.

---

### ⚡ Memory & Performance — Span, Memory, and the Stack
*"What if you could process a million records without a single heap allocation?"*

`Span<T>`, `ReadOnlySpan<T>`, `Memory<T>`. Stack vs heap allocation. `stackalloc`. `ArrayPool<T>`. `ref` returns and `ref` structs. Why `string.AsSpan()` is faster than `Substring()`. The `[SkipLocalsInit]` trick.

> **Payoff:** You'll know exactly how ASP.NET Core achieves its benchmark numbers — and apply the same tricks.

---

### 🌊 Async Streams & Channels
*"What if your data source never ends? Stream it."*

`IAsyncEnumerable<T>`, `yield return` in async methods, `Channel<T>` for producer-consumer pipelines, backpressure, bounded channels. Real-time data streaming without blocking.

> **Payoff:** You'll know how to build live data feeds, log streamers, and real-time pipelines in C#.

---

### 🎭 Pattern Matching (Deep Dive)
*"switch statements grew up. They're unrecognizable now."*

`switch` expressions, `when` guards, positional patterns, list patterns, property patterns. Recursive patterns. Type patterns. How pattern matching interacts with `records`. Discriminated union simulation in C#.

> **Payoff:** You'll write state machine logic that reads like English and compiles to blazing-fast code.

---

### 📦 Source Generators & Compile-Time Metaprogramming
*"Write code that writes code — at compile time, with zero runtime cost."*

Roslyn Source Generators. Incremental generators. `partial` classes. How `System.Text.Json` generates serializers at compile time instead of using reflection. How `ILogger` source generation works.

> **Payoff:** You'll understand the future of high-performance .NET and be able to eliminate reflection from hot paths.

---

### 🔒 Unsafe Code & Interop
*"Drop the safety rails. Go as fast as C."*

`unsafe` blocks, `fixed` keyword, raw pointers, `stackalloc`, P/Invoke, calling native C/C++ libraries from C#. How Span<T> is actually implemented. `Marshal` class.

> **Payoff:** You'll know how to write C-speed code in C# and interop with native libraries.

---

### 🏛️ CLR Internals — What Happens When Your Code Runs
*"The most exciting thing you'll learn: C# is not what executes. IL is. And JIT turns it into machine code."*

IL (Intermediate Language), the JIT compiler, method tables, virtual dispatch, boxing/unboxing cost, how `interface` calls work differently from `class` calls. GC generations and what triggers a collection.

> **Payoff:** You'll never write an accidental O(n²) loop or an unexpected boxing allocation again.
