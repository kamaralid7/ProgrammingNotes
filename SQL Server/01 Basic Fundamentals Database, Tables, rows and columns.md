Here’s a clear and simple explanation of the **basic fundamentals of databases**, including **tables, rows, and columns** — perfect if you're just getting started.

# 📘 **Database Fundamentals**

A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be stored, retrieved, and managed efficiently. Databases are used everywhere—banking systems, e-commerce websites, school systems, apps, and more.

---

# 🧱 **1. What Is a Database?**

A **database** stores data in a structured way so that it can be easily accessed, updated, and searched.
In relational databases (like **SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL**), data is stored in **tables**.

---

# 📊 **2. What Is a Table?**

A **table** is like a spreadsheet or an Excel sheet.
It stores information in a structured format using **rows** and **columns**.

Example table:

| **ID** | **Name** | **Age** |
| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| 1      | John     | 20      |
| 2      | Sarah    | 22      |

A database can have **many tables**, each storing different types of information.

For example:

* **Students**
* **Courses**
* **Teachers**
* **Orders**
* **Products**

---

# 🧩 **3. What Are Columns?**

A **column** represents a single attribute or category of data within a table.

Example:

* In a **Students** table, columns might be:

  * `StudentID`
  * `FirstName`
  * `LastName`
  * `Age`
  * `Email`

Each column has:

* A **name** (e.g., Age)
* A **data type** (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE)

Think of columns as **headings**.

---

# 📚 **4. What Are Rows?**

A **row** represents one complete record in the table.

Example row in a Students table:

| StudentID | FirstName | LastName | Age |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | --- |
| 1         | John      | Doe      | 20  |

Each row contains one value for every column.

---

# 🧠 **5. How Tables, Rows, and Columns Work Together**

Think of a table as a grid:

* **Columns** = What kind of data is stored
* **Rows** = Actual data entries

Example:

| ProductID | ProductName | Price |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 101       | Keyboard    | 25.99 |
| 102       | Mouse       | 15.49 |

Here:

* The **table** is called *Products*.
* The **columns** are ProductID, ProductName, Price.
* The **rows** represent individual products in the store.
